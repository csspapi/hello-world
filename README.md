# hello-world
This is my first repository
Hi there world. My name is Carlos Fiffe and im having a hard time in the world right now. I want to learn to code because I want to learn how to build and communicate better. in my 30 years of being alive i have failed on doing both. i just found github and im hoping for the best.
